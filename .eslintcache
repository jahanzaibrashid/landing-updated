Even if “stablecoins” may be\r\n            used in providing the services delivered through the Platform, the\r\n            stability of such assets also cannot be guaranteed or assured.

A significant portion of demand for these assets is\r\n            generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the\r\n            short- or long-term holding of blockchain assets. The market value\r\n            of any Tokens may decline below the price paid. You acknowledge that\r\n            the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and\r\n            blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum are variable and may\r\n            increase dramatically at any time, resulting in prolonged inability\r\n            to access or use the Services. The valuation of digital Tokens in a\r\n            secondary market is usually not transparent, and highly speculative.\r\n            The Tokens do not hold any ownership rights to Our assets or the\r\n            assets of Our Affiliates and, therefore, are not backed by any\r\n            tangible physical asset that We own.

The Ethereum network is prone to\r\n            periodic congestion during which transactions could be delayed or\r\n            lost.

Moreover, advances in\r\n            cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of\r\n            quantum computing, could present risks by undermining or vitiating\r\n            the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum\r\n            protocol.

Advances in code cracking or technical advances such\r\n            as the development of quantum computers may present risks to the\r\n            services delivered through the Platform, which could result in the\r\n            theft, loss or inaccessibility thereof.
