If a liquid trading market for the Tokens does not\r\n            develop, the price of the Tokens may become more volatile and the\r\n            Token holder may be unable to sell or otherwise transact in the\r\n            Tokens at any time.

Even if “stablecoins” may be\r\n            used in providing the services delivered through the Platform, the\r\n            stability of such assets also cannot be guaranteed or assured. As\r\n            relatively new products and technologies, blockchain-based assets\r\n            are not widely accepted as a means of payment for goods and\r\n            services. A significant portion of demand for these assets is\r\n            generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the\r\n            short- or long-term holding of blockchain assets. The market value\r\n            of any Tokens may decline below the price paid. You acknowledge that\r\n            the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and\r\n            blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum are variable and may\r\n            increase dramatically at any time, resulting in prolonged inability\r\n            to access or use the Services. The valuation of digital Tokens in a\r\n            secondary market is usually not transparent, and highly speculative.\r\n            The Tokens do not hold any ownership rights to Our assets or the\r\n            assets of Our Affiliates and, therefore, are not backed by any\r\n            tangible physical asset that We own. There is a high risk that a\r\n            Token holder could lose his/her entire contribution amount and that\r\n            the Tokens could be rendered worthless.\r\n          </Typography>\r\n          <Typography className=\"contentText\">\r\n            1.4 Tokens May Have No Value: The Tokens may have no value and there\r\n            is no guarantee or representation of liquidity for the Tokens.

Advances in code cracking or technical advances such\r\n            as the development of quantum computers may present risks to the\r\n            services delivered through the Platform, which could result in the\r\n            theft, loss or inaccessibility thereof.
